<h1>Managing a larger API</h1>

The previous slides and example code were small, and could potentially expose methods in your code that were not meant for public consumption.<br>
<br>
Here we will make some changes to declare which methods are mean for API vs private methods.<br>
As well as making it so that we can scale our code to allow several separate sections<br>

<ul>
    <li> lib/DemoApi.pm
    <li> lib/DemoApi/Math.pm
    <li> lib/DemoApi/System.pm
</ul>
